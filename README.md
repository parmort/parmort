I'm a Linux user and lover of open source and tiling WMs.

I occasionally contribute to projects I use on a frequent basis, like [neovim][nv],
[polybar][pb], and [telescope][ts]. Too much of my time is spent on tweaking my
[dotfiles][df] as well.

[pb]: https://github.com/polybar/polybar
[df]: https://github.com/parmort/dotfiles
[ts]: https://github.com/nvim-lua/telescope.nvim
